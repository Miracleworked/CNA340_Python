# Project Title

Use aColor as part of the computation in a for-Loop in a turtle Module to create a square. Once this program is run aColor will take on any of the attributes of the turtle. All of the for-Loop compound statement is executed completely before going to the next sequential statement. wn.exitonclick() will close the window (canvas) when the it is clicked on with the mouse.

## Getting Started
You will need a device and an operating system that is compatible with the required storage for the download of the software. 


### Prerequisites

Turtle Module (object) requires the installation of the latest version of Python 3.7.3 with the additional IDE of PyCharm to run code. OS systems include downloads for Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and other Platforms. See link below for complete details. If you do not have your own personal computer you can the interactive site Runestone Academy (link below)


## Running

import turtle            #imports the turtle module, set up Lexi     

wn = turtle.Screen()     #creates the turtle window

wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")   #canvas background lightgreen

lexi = turtle.Turtle()    #creates turtle named lexi

for aColor in ["yellow","red", "purple", "blue"]:    #applies each color attribute to lexi using for-Loop iteration
     lexi.color (aColor)   
     lexi.forward(50)      #moves lexi 50 pixels forward
     lexi.left(90)         #moves lexi 90 pixels left to complete square

wn.exitonclick()
